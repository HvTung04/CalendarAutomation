## How I came up with the idea?
  My second-year first semester is coming in a few weeks, as I already got a list of every classes that I must finish in this upcoming semester, to put all that on Google Calendar was such a headache. So I came up with the idea, hop on Youtube to learn how to use Google Calendar API and that's it!
## How to use?
- Create a Google Cloud project, then download the credentials.json file after create an OAuth client ID.
- Put on the same folder, maybe change the timezone.
